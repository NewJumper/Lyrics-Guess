The Good Part=
One two three four
Have I done my best here, or
Will I be here next year, or
Are these my best years yet?
Was looking forward to
Being important but
I'm not important yet
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the world gets me
Where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
Can we skip to the good part?
One two three four
One two three four
If there's a good part then
I hope it's not far 'cause
I thought it'd be today (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I napped on campus and
I smoked at dances but
It didn't feel so great
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the world gets me
Where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
So can we skip to the good part?
One two three four
One two three four (can we skip to the good part?)
Ah, ah-ah-ah (to the good part, to the good part)
One two three four
One two three four
These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But, what am I gonna do with mine?
These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But, what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
Weak=
"No thank you" is what I should've said, I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue, troubles yet to come
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that)
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love ya when I fall for that
Sober Up (feat. Rivers Cuomo)=
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
Won't you help me sober up
Growing up it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up
All the big kids they are drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again
How's it go again?
Goodbye, goodbye
I said to my bestest buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smiled at party time
But soon we forgot to smile
At anything else
Won't you help me sober up
Growing up it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up
All the big kids they are drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again
How's it go again?
How's it go again?
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
And I wanna feel something again
I just wanna feel something again
How's it go again?
Won't you help me sober up
Growing up it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up
All the big kids they are drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
Can I finally feel something again?
How's it go again?
Drama=
When did all my friends become so loud?
We act like reality shows
Probably 'cause reality blows
When did all my friends become so loud?
We traded our boring lives
For MTV story lines
Why?
Recently he said that she said that we said
Some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said
That he said some shit about me
So we're caught up in drama
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
We're caught up in problems
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
Hold up, hold up
Can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up
But I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking
Everybody's talking now
When did all our problems get so small?
We break up with lovers and friends
Make love to the rumours instead
Maybe we're addicted to it all
The drama is dangerous
But it's so exciting to us
Recently he said that she said that we said
Some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said
That he said some shit about me
So we're caught up in drama
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
We're caught up in problems
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
Hold up, hold up
Can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up
But I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking
Everybody's talking now
When did my friends get so loud?
When did my friends get so loud?
When did my friends get so loud?
Oh, when did my friends get loud?
Recently he said that she said that we said
Some shit that you wouldn't believe

That he said some shit about me
So we're caught up in drama
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
We're caught up in problems
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talking)
(Everybody's talking)
Hold up, hold up
Can we make it stop?
But I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking
Everybody's talking now
Everybod-everybod-every
Everybody's talking
Turning Out=
I hold you
I hold you closer then I ever knew
I could do
But I'm confused
I thought I'd recognize when love was true
But I'm confused
Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference
Do you have instructions?
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I think I'm still turning out
In my mind
I thought the birds would sing and sparks would fly
But it's just quiet
Am I cruel?
Or am I ignorant or was I fooled
By the stories I knew?
Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference
Do you have instructions?
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I hope you stick around
We're gonna figure it out
Who can I turn to now?
When I'm still turning out
When I'm still turning out
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?
'Cause I'm still turning out
No Grass Today=
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
Does the grass look greener on my side of the speakers?
I tried a couple weekends, but that green's not for me
I thought I'd get clever
Make my lyrics come out better
But at 7/11's where you would find me
Don't wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be makin' noise
You wanna hit? It's your choice
But please enjoy the show
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
Last night at the concert
The audience it flickers
They're lighting up like Christmas 'til that green's not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain't no concern of mine
I keep doing me
Don't wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You wanna hit? It's your choice
But please enjoy the show
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I'm not narcissistic
I'm just high off the music
And I don't wanna miss it
But I wouldn't stop you
I'm not narcissistic
You light up if you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you
You just keep doing you
Keep, keep doing
Keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me
Keep, keep doing
Keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me
Keep, keep doing
Keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
Three-Thirty=
Never spoken with my mouth full
Yeah that's a mouthful and I'm doubtful
That I could get these lyrics out, oh
Cause I think fast but I sing slow
If I ever started rapping
They'd be laughing, they won't believe me
But I got so much I wanna say
So I'm thinking rappers, they got it easy
Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
So if no one's paying attention
Then does my voice get to your headphones
You start thinking about the clock ticks
You get nervous, you start stressing
So how am I supposed to fit this
In three minutes and thirty seconds
Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
Wealthy people learned their lesson
And never donate without the press there
You wanna skip it if it's wordy
But fit the whole song in three-thirty
I thought I had the ADHD
But that's a real thing and I'm just lazy
Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
Listen to my aching heart
Will you keep this record on
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts
Call My Dad=
Oh my God, what's going on?
This night got fuckin' weird
Drove so fast my brain got buzzed
And now I'm standin' here
Met so many faces that
Will probably forget me
Boy, I bet I look so grown up
Shirt tucked in my jeans
And now after it all, I just really wanna call
My dad, my dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
We went dancing on the roof
And took some girls uptown
They started fighting with my friend
And I can't find him now
Hit some bars, and saw some brawls
And found a house to sleep
Forgot my retainer
Could you not be mad at me?
'Cause now, after it all, I'm just standing here to call
My dad, my dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
I'm Not Famous=
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
You've never heard of me
Or the weird shit I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no
And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
'Cause I'm not famous, no
Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
You never overheard
That I blew twenty grand on shirts
Nobody knows my quirks
'Cause I'm not famous, no
Everyone got their habits
But you'll never hear what mine is
Best thing about my life is I'm not famous, no
Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
Hate it, hate-hate it (no)
Hate it, hate- hate it
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
(No, no)
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
(I'm not, I'm not)
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
(I'm not famous)
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
Netflix Trip=
I had my first crush in season two
She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue
And in my corduroy's we'd walk to school
I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do
She moved away I was on season three
It hit my heart so hard I'd hardly speak
But I could find some peace and privacy
A paper company to sit with me
Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
I turned down Jameson when I was twelve
I spent that Friday night with Steve Carrell
The one where Dwight became the head of Sales
My eighth grade graduation wished me well
I lost my grandfather in season six
I watched my mom, she cried and held her kids
My mind was broken up I couldn't think
So I just hugged her the way Michael did
But who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Time's where we're going
Tell me who I am
Take in every moment
Hold it close again
Now the finale's done and I'm alone
I'm on a Netflix Trip here on my phone
But who I am is in these episodes
So don't you tell me that it's just a show
Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
But who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Bud Like You=
Way up, way up
Way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up
Way up to the moon
Boy it's good to know I've got a bud like you
Enough, enough
There's no celebrities here
So why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously
It's you, and I
It's cool you feel the same
Like why's the DJ here, if he's just pressing play
Kicking in the basement
Kicking in the basement
Hating all the same things too
If I need a pick me up
Would you come and pick me
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me way up, way up
Way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up
Way up to the moon
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you
Way up, way up
Way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up
Way up to the moon
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you
Enough, enough
There's no one here that we know
I think I knew a girl, who knew the host
But she's heading home
We'll stand a lot
Stare at the disco ball
Like who'd invest in that
When no ones looking at it
Kicking in the basement
Kicking in the basement
Hating all the same things too
If I need a pick me up
Would you come and pick me
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me way up, way up
Way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up
Way up to the moon
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you
Way up, way up

Come Hang Out=
Come hang out
'Cause you're outta your mind
You're working so damn hard
You forgot what you like
And come hang out
Don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time
I can't complain, no, I won't be mourning
'Cause I skipped on prom
For Elvis Duran in the morning
All of my life I have been starving
Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist
Yep yep I'm gonna miss this someday

While I'm doing promo, tryna blow up in Chicago
Yep yep I'm gonna miss it someday
Yep yep I missed another Friday
And all my friends say

Burn The House Down=
Used to keep it cool
Used to be a fool
All about the bounce in my step
Watch it on the news
Whatcha gonna do?
I could hit refresh and forget
Used to keep it cool
Should I keep it light?
Stay out of the fight?
No one's gonna listen to me
If I write a song
Preaching what is wrong
Will they let me sing on TV?
Should I keep it light?
Is that right?
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You're only serving lies
You've got something to hide
We gon' burn the whole house down
We gon' burn the whole house down
Yeah, used to let it go
Walk into the show
Gawking at the tricks up your sleeve
Too good to be true
But I'm in a room
Full of entertainers and thieves
Used to let it go
Woah, oh no
(Woah, oh no)
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You're only serving lies
You've got something to hide
We gon' burn the whole house down
We gon' burn the whole house down
Should I hang my head low?
Should I bite my tongue?
Or should I march with every stranger
From Twitter to get shit done?
Used to hang my head low
Now I hear it loud
Every stranger from Twitter is gonna burn this down
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down

We burn it down, we burn it down
We gon' burn the whole house down
Role Models=
Three, four
All my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
Would've never come so far, without someone there to start again
I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons
This time of year, I'm feelin' weird, might be allergies
Wanna move out, but when I move out, who'll be proud of me
Thought I was made, from men that were great, put that crown on me
Thought I was made, from Louis C.K
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
Would've never come so far, without someone there to start again
I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons
I used to say, just what's on my brain, 'cause you always did
You used to be, so special to me, now you've taken it
Look at this mess, should I forget, what you gave to me?
Look at this mess, wake up Mr. West
'Cause, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
Would've never come so far, without someone there to start again
I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons
Would've never come so far, without someone there to start again
I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons
Normal=
That was my favorite song, don't listen much anymore
My likeness isn't me, my likeness isn't at all, mm
Is it normal to stand here, and wish that I was back at home?
Is it normal to tell her I can't be normal anymore?
I don't know
So maybe I should go back home
I made a party song, so I'm in all of the dorms
I showed up once or twice, I think I'm missing the point, mm
Is it normal to stand here, and wish that I was back at home?
Is it normal to tell her I can't be normal anymore?
I don't know
So maybe I should go back home
So maybe I should go back home
Maybe I should go back home
My friends have all new friends, I'm scared that they like 'em more
So I made a party song, now I'm in every dorm
