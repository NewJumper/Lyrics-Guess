On Purpose=
Your eyes
Crashing into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words
Didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough
All these days I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance
With you
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose
My dreams runnin' into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart
And all these days I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? (Who knew?)
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance
With you
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
But I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
On purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
(Oh, you were scared)
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
But I guess that we did it on purpose, on purpose, on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Feels Like Loneliness=
You're not asking for much but
It just seems like a lot and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me
I'm not ready for your love
I keep on the go but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're beggin' me please
But darling, it's not the way to get me baby, no
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew, so baby
You pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love -ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same, and I'm through
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes
Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Thumbs=
Somewhere in the world there, is a father and a mother
And the father is a son, who has a mother
The mother has a daughter who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends till the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
Somewhere in the world, they think they're working for themselves
They get up everyday to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them and, so, they think they got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Somewhere in the world, you got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people, so the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just workin' to get paid the very same
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends till the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs
'Cause that's just the way of the world (way of the world)
It never ends till the end, and then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (keep on)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs

No Words=
No words, no words, no words
When everything's quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
But even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beating in the bars
Beating in the bars, beating in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beating in the bars
Beating in the bars, beating in the bars
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words
When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
When nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
(No words, no)
No, no, no
(All we need is no words)
No, no
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

(No words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beating in the bars
Beating in the bars, beating in the bars
No, no, no words

Run and Hide=
I don't want to buy what they're selling these days
Saying feeling and falling is all a mistake, no, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts feeling love
Like it's just a matter of time before they break, no, no
They started saying when you can't hide, run
When you can't run, hide
Started thinking love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded out holding hands to holding back everything, no, no
And words got shorter, and quiet got longer
And all of a sudden love started looking like a memory
They started saying if you can't hide, run
If you can't run, hide
Started thinking love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide, no
They started saying when you can't hide, run
When you can't run, hide
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losing fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
Mirage=
They said, "You can't wear Giamba"
Baby, you gotta pay
Well then, we got a problem, problem
And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
And we just go through the motions
Yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talking
Believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
Is it real, is it real or not
Is it real everything we've got
Or not
Is it real, is it real or not
Is it real, everything that we've got ooh
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
Is it just a mirage?
Don't Want It Back=
You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Baby, you're home
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're living for tonight
You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back
This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're living for tonight
You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You give me a reason (huh)
You give me a feeling (huh)
And all of the things you've given to me
You give 'em to me, baby
You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Shadows=
We all got nightmares in our dreams
We look for someone to believe in us
And show us the way
And make it okay
The world can be dangerous
There's something so rare in your veins
Not a single thing I would change
And oh, if you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again, alive again?
I, I need you to understand
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
Pictures in our head
Of what we're supposed to be
Measuring ourselves, but where is the love?
Where is the love?
The world got us wondering, wondering
I, I need you to understand
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
And all these voices in our head
Well, they keep screaming louder and louder
But they won't pull us under
Baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't

So give me a little, give me a little (ah) a little more space

All We Have Is Love=
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)
We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When everyday is ecstasy
We won't let the stars-crossed change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me (next to me, next to me)
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)
