Singular Act II
9
In My Bed=
Little things become everything
When you wouldn't think that they would
Little things weigh so heavily
Take my energy 'til it's gone
I wanna be alone
But love is emotions
Wanna be alone
I'm tryna, I'm tryna
I'm tryna stop them
Losing my control
I prefer to go away
I could let it go easy
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still in my bed
Turn this pillowcase
To the cooler side
Give me something I can't feel
'Cause I wanna turn a page
Wanna rearrange
Swing the doors wide open in my mind
I wanna be alone (wanna be alone)
But love is emotions
Wanna be alone
I'm tryna, I'm tryna
I'm tryna stop them
Losing my control (my control)
I prefer to go away
I could let it go easy
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it (head about it)
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
Something chemical inside me messin' with my mind
And I can't help but feel like
I'm feeling like someone else (someone else)
Something animal inside me
Trying to remind me there's no need
To worry about it and lose myself
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it (bed about it)
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it (I)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my bed
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still in my bed about it
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still in my bed

You say I'm overly dramatic and I know
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach

Tell Me=
Got me in my feelings, mm
What the hell you doin' to me?
I can't help what I'm feelin'
Yeah, 'cause I'm falling down like a summer rain
People asking what we do, and I don't say a thing
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change
Should we tell 'em? Mm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're liftin' me up feel like heaven, mm

We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell (tell 'em)
(Got to tell them, babe, got to tell them, babe)
Ain't no reason why we need to tell nobody
We don't gotta give it any labels
Cards already on the table
And we don't need opinions in our head space
You and me already in a good place
Like whoa, stay
Let's keep it this way
People asking what we do, and I don't say a thing, no
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?

Exhale=
Who put the baby in charge?
It's already hard to buy all the parts and learn to use them
Who put the world on my back and not in my hands
Just give me a chance
Listen to my mama, listen to my dad
Listen to my sisters, everyone relax
Everybody answers shit I didn't ask
Think I'm reaching my limit
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second?
I put too much weight on words and glances
I, I put too much weight on situations
I, I put too much on myself
Thinking "I don't deserve what I've earned", but yeah
I listen to the labels, listen to the man
Try to keep a sense of knowing who I am
I try to be an angel but I don't think I can
Think I'm reaching my limits, yeah
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second, baby?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Take You Back=
I picked you out 'cause you were shiny and new
Had all the features, even came with tattoos
But I just figured out now what hindsight is
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Should've just bought a new pair of shoes
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna put you back, na-na
Closest I've ever come to buyer's remorse
If you don't make me happy, then what good are you for?
But I just figured out now what hindsight is
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Should've just bought a new pair of shoes
I wanna take you back, take you back, uh
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
(I wanna put you back, na-na)
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
(Take you back, wanna take you back)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again (rid of it, rid of it, na)
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
if it ain't broke, don't fix it

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
I wanna put you back where I found you
Back to where you came from
I wanna take you back, oh no
Looking at Me=
Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
Where my lips and my soles are at
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks, no, no
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes (come on)
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
