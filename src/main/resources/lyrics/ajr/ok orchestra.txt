Bummerland=
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
This month, I got seven haircuts
And now my hair is all gone
It's sad but I've been alone for too long
So I keep getting haircuts
It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, sorry dear
But you're only going up from here
My friends always pay for my drinks
I can't afford no nice things
But I hope my bank account gets so low
Even zero
So next year
When I buy that first beer
I'll be a goddamn hero
It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, sorry dear
But you're only going up from here
'cause you're only going up from here
It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland, here I am
And there ain't no funner land
Bummerland, it's kinda weird
But you're only going up from here
3 O'Clock Things=
Come on guy, I promise everything will be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing
(Come on guy, I promise everything will be alright, be okay)
(Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open)
('Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing)
It's kinda funny how I paid for college when YouTube was an option
But then I would've had to spend my best years
Skipping ads and reading comments
And when the hell did advertisements get so good? They're like narcotics
So now I'm spending every penny I own
I should've allotted to finishing college
It's kinda funny how I keep debating
If someone's shy or if they hate me
I feel like everyone I know right now
Is hooking up and getting wasted (without me)
And maybe sex is overrated but we're too shy to ever say it (say it)
So we pretend we're all amazing
It's three AM I should be sleeping (sleeping)
Would you go running if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em
Yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no that's super scary
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not
It's kinda funny how you vote for someone
To vote for someone, to vote for someone (someone)
And you might end up with someone evil but you say that he means well
If I keep on talking politics, my friends will dip, they're over it
If I keep on talking politics, I'm Hamilton (without the hits)
Would you go running if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em
Yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no that's super scary
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not
Isn't this obvious? Am I insane?
Let's blame our parents 'cause they taught us their ways
Stay out of politics, stay on the fence
Stay out of all of it to keep half your fans
Isn't this obvious? Am I insane?
There might be two sides to everything that you say
It's all a bit cloudy but there's one thing I know
That if you're fucking racist then don't come to my show
My Play=
I put on a play in my old house
In my cape, jumpin' on the old couch
Puttin' up lights when it's cold out
Mom and dad, both seats sold out
Show you my play
Haven't seen the old house lately
Wonder if they found my spaceship
I don't want my own love wasted
Tell me this is what you're saying
If you both outgrew one another
I could start now, lookin' for a lover
But if love dies, do I fuckin' bother?
I just really, really, really, really wanna show you my play
And I don't wanna do it for dad at dad's new place
I worked really, really, really, really hard, let me show you my play
And I don't wanna do it twice 'cause it's not the same
I've been on dates, bringin' flowers
Tryna be great for an hour
You and me might go sour
But if we don't hold out, then we're cowards
I put on a play in my basement (basement)
Mom and dad's smiling faces (faces)
But now I don't know if they faked it (faked it)
Guess everything is complicated
If you both outgrew one another
I could start now, lookin' for a lover
But if love dies, do I fuckin' bother?
I just really, really, really, really wanna show you my play
And I don't wanna do it for dad at dad's new place
I worked really, really, really, really hard, let me show you my play
And I don't wanna do it twice 'cause it's not the same
You did everything, everything, everything that you could
We do everything, everything, everything 'til it's through
I'll do everything, everything, everything when I'm you
But when I show you my play
Will you pretend you didn't know if I make a mistake?
It's gonna get really, really, really, really bad before it's okay
But maybe you'll forget it all while you're watchin' my play
Joe=
I believed in god back in eighth grade
He could smoke an eighth on a school day
Remember when you laughed at my last name?
Now I go by Met, is that less lame
Of a last name?
I believed in god back in '09
Always down to hang he had no time, yeah
But in a couple of years, I'll be so out of here
I'll have a lot of new friends and I won't even care
I don't ever think of you
I got too much stuff to do
Should've left you back in school
Joseph, do you think I'm
I don't ever think of you
Look at all this stuff I do
I played shows in Belarus
Now Joe, do you think I'm cool?
Do you think I'm cool?
I could make a joke but it feels strange
Every time she laughed it would feel fake
But you could make her laugh in a real way
Yeah, I still use your jokes and they go great
It took a little while but I found love
I thought you'd reply you just thumbed up
I play a lot of shows but you don't come
I don't even mind this is so dumb, so dumb
I don't ever think of you
I got too much stuff to do
Should've left you back in school
Joseph, do you think I'm
I don't ever think of you
Look at all this stuff I do
Probably not as much as you
Still, Joe, do you think I'm cool?
Do you think I'm cool?
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I got friends all up the coast
Proud of all the songs I wrote
But I can't take this backpack off
It comes with me where I go
Maybe I'll put out this song
And I won't change your name at all
Maybe then you'll call me up
And you'll tell me how cool I got
Adventure Is Out There=
I keep losing my socks
Where the hell do they go?
I bet they're finally free
Floating somewhere in the sea
Do they miss my feet?
I keep losing my socks
I got nothing to wear
I bet they're at her place
A house where I can't show my face
How I wanna be there
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there
Adventure is out there
So why am I in here
So why am I in here today?
Think I'm losing my mind
How pathetic and tired
Think where they could be
Some hotel in Germany
Hope they're loving the ride
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there
Adventure is out there
So why am I in here
So why am I in here today?
I bought me some new socks
I won't lose them I'm sure
And someday hopefully
I'll slip away and they'll lose me
And I'll be seeing the world
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there
Adventure is out there
So why am I in here
So why am I in here today?
Why am I in here today?
Why am I in here today?
Bang!=
I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, I'm not feeling grown

The Trick=
I've got a dog and my dog can dance
Just not in public and not with my friends
I've got a girl and she's twenty-eight
Now, I'm the coolest guy in all of eighth grade
I know a kid that you've never met
His dad was a rockstar, we smoked in his van
I know a trick, do you want to see?
I can be anything that I pretend to be
We'll get out of this
We'll get out of this too
I'm not proud of this
But I'm not proud of the truth
And if you run from me
Then I'll use my trick on you
The truth is that I'm screwed
I went to France and danced in the rain
And told you all about it on our first date
My dad doesn't lie so you can't meet my dad
'Cause you fell in love with the me that went to France
We'll get out of this
We'll get out of this too
I'm not proud of this
But I'm not proud of the truth
And if you run from me
Then I'll use my trick on you
The truth is that we're screwed
We'll get out of this
'Cause I love you, I do
We'll get out of this
'Cause I love you, it's true
But if you're doubting this
If you're doubting that I do
Then oh my God, I'm screwed
Ordinaryish People (feat. Blue Man Group)=
Your happy friends call you depressing
'Cause you wonder why we're all alive
Your downer friends think you're too happy, too happy
'Cause you still celebrate sometimes
Your hippie friends call you a sellout
'Cause you buckle down and get a job
You still get high, but you're no hippie, no hippie
But all your work friends think you are
I guess the last time you had any fun
Was way back when you weren't anyone
So goodbye ordinaryish people
We had quite the run, didn't we, though?
But you gotta be somebody sometime
I don't wanna pack up and leave, though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
Your pretty friends, they call you ugly
Your ugly friends, they call you vain
No, you're not stupid, you're just special, special
Well, that's what all your smart friends say
I guess the last time you had any fun
(Oh, the last time you had any fun)
Was way back when you weren't anyone
(Way back when you weren't anyone)
So goodbye ordinaryish people
We had quite the run, didn't we, though?
But you gotta be somebody sometime
I don't wanna pack up and leave, though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
Your attention, please
Please, please yell if you're paying attention
I don't wanna pack up and leave, though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
Humpty Dumpty=
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around
Something's wrong
But I'm scared to look it up
If I do that
And no one has it
I'll feel so alone
Something's wrong
But don't pity me for long
If you get sad
Then I'll feel bad
That I told you at all
I got friends in a lotta weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
Depending what my face is
What my face is
I could fake it
I could move away or I could
Suck it up and face it
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
There's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
Okay
Look outside
They're making snowmen on your street
Underneath your pillow
You can sigh yourself to sleep
Look outside
They're making snowmen on your street
Hide behind your pillow
Close the window
Cause you know you can't be seen
I got friends in a lotta weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
Depending what my face is
If I can't breathe
Then you can't see
But aren't you excited that I'm giving you
The best me?
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
There's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
When no one, when no one's around
If I try
To keep my tears in my eyes
Would you like me
Would you like me
Would you like me
If I try
To keep my tears in my eyes
Would you like me
Would you like me
Would you like me
I got shows in a lot of weird places
Wonder if they're gonna come
Depending what my face is
Remember Vegas
I can't take another panic episode
When I get off the stage, man
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around (when no one's around)
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
There's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
World's Smallest Violin=
My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom, and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin
that's so insane
(Oh, my God) that's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
My grandpa fought in World War II
And he was such a noble dude
Man, I feel like such a fool
I got so much left to prove
All my friends have vaping friends
They're so good at making friеnds
I'm so scared of caving in
Is that entertaining yеt?
that's so insane
(Oh, my God) that's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
Somewhere in the universe
Somewhere someone's got it worse
Wish that made it easier
Wish I didn't feel the hurt
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
All up and down a city street
While tryna put my mind at ease
Like finishing this melody
This feels like a necessity
So this could be the death of me
Or maybe just a better me
Now, come in with the timpanis
And take a shot of Hennessy
I know I'm not there mentally
But you could be the remedy
So let me play my violin for you
Way Less Sad=
I should move 'cause New York is gettin' muddy out
There's L.A. but it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Shut up and just enjoy this feelin'
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Hеy-hey-hey, hey-hеy-hey, hey-hey-hey
But I'm way less sad
Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey (oh-oh-oh), hey-hey-hey
But I'm way less sad
I wake up and I'm not so mad at Twitter now
Livin' sucks but it's suckin' just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Shut up and just enjoy this feelin'
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet (happy yet)
But I'm way less sad
I may wrong, I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Well, I can't fall asleep and I'm losin' my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I've been countin' sheep but the sheep all died
And I'm tryin' too hard but I can't not try
Well, I can't fall asleep and I'm losin' my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire (brain's on fire)
I've been countin' sheep but the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet (happy yet)
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it, don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Christmas In June=
Ok, I'm ready
New Year's Eve
I was at a festival in New Orleans
You were in Tribeca kissin' nobody
I owe you one, yes, I do
Valentine's Day
We decided we would do the whole damn thing
But I played to an empty gym in Iowa State
I guess I owe you that too
I try so hard to be so happy, are you happy too?
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down, but just in case
Can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God
How lucky am I to have two things I love?
Makes it that much easier to fuck it up
In case I miss it, can we do Christmas in June?
I skipped prom
I thought I would blow up from that radio spot
Remember how you chuckled when you heard that song?
But you won't be laughing soon
One big day, one big show'll make 'em know my name
But if it ends up falling on our wedding day
Oh, God, don't make me choose
I try so hard to be so happy, are you happy too?
I know you try to
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down, but just in case
Can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God
How lucky am I to have two things I love?
Makes it that much easier to fuck it up
I hate to do this, can we do Christmas in June?
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down, but just in case
Can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God
How lucky am I to have two things I love?
Makes it that much easier to fuck it up
I hate to do this, don't wanna lose this
Can we do Christmas in June?
Hold on, love
A little longer while I get the album done
And if I get to tour it, wouldn't that be fun?
But that's one less month with you
Holy shit
Now I'm sittin', thinking 'bout what else I'll miss
Darling, if we're ever gonna have a kid
Don't wanna miss it, can we just have him in June?
