Singular Act I

Almost Love=
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So, baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah, yeah
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love, it could be
I want you like a midnight hour wants a view
I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you
And we could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So, baby, what's the hold up?
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
Almost love
It's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah, no, no
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're getting it so close
Now you're getting this so close
Almost love, almost love
Oh, 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
It's almost love
Almost love, oh, baby
It's almost love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love and you know
Almost love
But it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Yeah, it could be love, eh
Paris=
If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, "It's understood"
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Yeah, I already have love in LA
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave (makes me leave)
Guess that's one of many things that's wrong with me (that's wrong with me)
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore (anymore)
Why'd it take so long for me to know this (know this)
Scared to put the water with the roses (roses)
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Already have love
It's so romantic in Paris (so romantic in Paris)
Won't even try to compare it (I know that I try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris, babe
Won't even try to compare it (won't even try, won't even try, won't even try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it (I was sure, I was sure)
But I already have love in LA
But I already have love in LA
Hold Tight=
Done everything and done it again
Not every party needs our attention
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah
But I was hoping we could switch up how we're spending our time
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
I just want that hand hold with the sweat in the middle
Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone
You can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers coloring your body reading braille
Take you to Bahamas seeping through the sand
Sucking out the silence now I'm in your ear
Telling you baby to listen I just
Wanna keep you in
Wanna keep you in right
Wanna feel your skin
Wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I've been on the internet forgetting
How to keep it slow but no I need it bitty
Bad bone Bonnie Clyde come and get it
I don't know I get it, get it, I get it, oh
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
We keep going, keep going, I just wanna
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Sue Me=
Remember when you said it
There's no second chance
Oh baby I heard you been hoping
You could change the past
You miss the long goodnights
You miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights
Well did you ever think that it was hard for me?
To walk it off like nothing happened nonchalantly
I got you feeling like
I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me (go!)
It's hard to see me on when you've been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see
What you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself, can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me (oh)
I, I, I, I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor
So sue me
For looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me
For being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
Sue me, baby, hmm
prfct=
You can get real close, talking, you're talking now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights, just to hide in the dark
(Hide in the) dark, (hide in the) dark
Think that I know you the farther you are
(Farther you are, farther you are)
Like, A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need
(That's what we need)
See right through the fiction, and all of this fakery
(All of this fakery)
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
(Nobody sees)
You don't think that I can handle the truth?
(Handle the truth, handle the truth)
Baby I'm over just playing it cool, oh
Like, A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
(You know that I want you, baby)
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it baby
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need
(That's what we need)
That's what we need
(That's what we need)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
(That's what we need, that's what we need)
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(Baby, do you think that you could give it to me)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
(That's what we need, that's what we need)
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need
Bad Time=
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You never finish your glass
Take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below
Wouldn't even open your door
You said "It's a bad time for a good time baby

Too many times I've asked myself
"What did I come here for?"

Mona Lisa=
Keep it casual, don't have to tippy toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in, before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay? Yeah
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
I know your type, what's
With the timid behavior
You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay? Yeah
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move

I could be yours by the time that we leave
