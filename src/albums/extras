Crazier|Taylor Swift=
I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
And there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh-oh
Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore, oh-oh
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier...
I Don't Wanna Live Forever|ZAYN, Taylor Swift=
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life
Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
All night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home
Gasoline (feat. Taylor Swift)|HAIM, Taylor Swift=
You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack
Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat
I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (Did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (Did it back, did it back)
You needed ass, well, what's
Wrong with that?
Gasoline (Gasoline), pretty please (Pretty please)
I want to get off (Gasoline)
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys (Throw the keys) back to me (Back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (Gasoline)
In the passenger seat
Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?
When you're lying between my legs it doesn't matter
Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?
Faster and faster
Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Birch|Big Red Machine, Taylor Swift=
The way I woke up was old
Was all fuckin' choke
And it ain't easier after a week
We're on a long byway standing
Well, if you cannot tell
I'll tell you right away
If I'll stay a spell
Or if I cannot stay
I am less at ease
Not the best at these
See the forest trees
Call what's these what's these
(What's these)
Hey, Madeline
Thanks
For to case out the fog for Jennifer
Seems she needed you badly
So I beg on knees
Can we share IDs?
Will you always need?
We have common needs
We can sure deplete
We can be replete
Address table needs
It is swift your speed
The way I wake up now
Is a brand-new way
And no it ain't that way
It was before
So I cannot leave
Yes, I must here stay
'Cause I know what's good
And I'll die that way
No, I cannot seem
To get a moment's peace
If there's a man like me
His birch ain't my tree
The way I wake up now
Is a brand-new way
It ain't the way it was before
Renegade|Big Red Machine, Taylor Swift=
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay
But I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might've let them lay
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history
It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say
Get your shit together?
So I can love you
Is it really your anxiety
That stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay
But I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles 'cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
Let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history
It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say
Get your shit together?
So I can love you
Is it really your anxiety
That stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might've let them lay
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history
It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say (let all your damage damage me)
Get your shit together (carry your baggage up my street)
So I can love you? (And make me your future history)
(It's time, you've come a long way) is it really your anxiety
(Open the blinds, let me see your face) that stops you from giving me everything
(You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody)
Or do you just not want to?
Christmas Tree Farm|Taylor Swift=
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(To you)
Under the mistletoe (to you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (darling)
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Where every wish comes true
I love you
The Joker And The Queen (feat. Taylor Swift)|Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift=
How was I to know?
It’s a crazy thing
I showed you my hand
And you still let me win
And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I’ve been played before
If you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close
To my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff
And saw through all my tells
And then you went all in
And we left together
And I know that you think what makes a king
Is gold, a palace and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
