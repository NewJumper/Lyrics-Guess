Jumpsuit=
Cover me, oh
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit (cover me)
Dusting off my, jumpsuit (cover me)
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone) if you need anyone
(If you need anyone) if you need anyone
(If you need anyone) if you need anyone
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Levitate=
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at first blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough
Yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures
I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please, keep me
Down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse
Now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you're the worst
Your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help
Welcome to Trench
Morph=
Can't stop thinking about if and when I'd die
For now I see that 'if' and 'when' are truly different cries
For 'if' is purely panic, and 'when' is solemn sorrow
And one invades today, while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded, and we're hounded
There's no 'above, ' or 'under, ' or 'around' it
For 'above' is blind belief, and 'under' is sword to sleeve
And 'around' is scientific miracle, let's pick 'above' and see
For if and when we go 'above, ' the question still remains:
Are we still in love, and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going 'under' starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this...
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close, but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico
He told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well we're surrounded, and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time I'll try and sing this...
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else
Lights they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded, and I'm hounded
There's no 'above, ' or 'under, ' or 'around' it
For 'above' is blind belief, and 'under' is sword to sleeve
And 'around' is scientific miracle, let's pick 'above' and see
For if and when we go 'above, ' the question still remains:
Are we still in love, and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going 'under' starts to take my wonder
But until that time...
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else
Not done, not done, not done
Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else
My Blood=
When everyone
You thought you knew
Deserts your fight
I'll go with you
You're facing down
A dark hall
I'll grab my light
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
Surrounded and
Up against a wall
I'll shred them all
And go with you
When choices end
You must defend
I'll grab my bat
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you, yeah

No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're calling for your head and they're calling for your name
I'll bomb down on them, I'm coming through
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
If you find yourself
In a lion's den
I'll jump right in
And pull my pin
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
I'll go with you
I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
I'll go with you
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah
Stay with me

No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
Chlorine=
So where are you? It's been a little while
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue
Dependant at times
Poisonous vibration
Help my body run
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Smithereens=
You know, I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know, I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if I'm feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know, I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens
You know, I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know-ow
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know, I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one on the record for you
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her...
Feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know they think it's messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens
Neon Gravestones=
Call, call, call
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solving
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss
Like it's a win and right before we turn on them
We give them the highest of praise
And hang their banner from a ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way
No!
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
Call, call, call, call
Call, call
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang, they would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say "How could he go if he's got everything?"
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
Call, call, call
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Neon gravestones try to call
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
Neon gravestones try to call
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
But they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression
A form of succession, a form of a weapon
Thinking "I'll teach them, " well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated!
The Hype=
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype (don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nico and the Niners=
East is up
I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up
I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up
When Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
East is up
They want to make you forget
They want to make you forget
Save your razorblades now, not yet
Save your razorblades now, not yet
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh
East is up
I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up
I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up
When Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh
What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a race horse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
East is up
I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up
I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up
When Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
East it up
Cut My Lip=
I'll keep on tryin', might as well
If you decide, all is well
I'll keep on tryin' (tryin'), might as well (might as well)
If you decide (decide), all is well (all is well)
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin'
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin'

Rust around the rim
Drink it anyway
I cut my lip

Blood is on my tongue

Even though it's me I abuse
I'll keep on goin' back

Bandito=
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where are we used to bleed
And where're our blood needs to be
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
In city, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Began with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through
Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo...
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban-, I'm a bandito (Folina)
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
Pet Cheetah=
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat, I should delete to exercise
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason Statham
I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing
I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me
I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat, I should delete to exercise
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah
Pet cheetah, pet cheetah

Legend=
You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows
You were one of those classic ones, yeah
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye
You were here when I wrote this
But the masters and mixes
Will take too long to finish
To show you
I'm sorry I did not visit
Did not know how to take it
When your eyes did not know me
Like I know you
You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows (wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones, yeah
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye
My goodbye, I, I, I
My goodbye
Then the day that it happened
I recorded this last bit
I look forward to having
A lunch with you again
Leave The City=
I'm tired of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing
Embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
The burning is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back with details from beyond
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost over
In time I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost...
They know that it's almost over
Last year, I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year, though I'm far from home
In Trench, I'm not alone
These faces facing me
They know...
They know...
What I mean
