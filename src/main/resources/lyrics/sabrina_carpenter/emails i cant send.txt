emails i can't send=
It's times like these wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October thirteenth
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lying to me and the family?
There's no us in us when I'm lacking trust
You wanna discuss, ugh
You disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out
Why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're having sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you for
Every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And, God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fucking fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you
I mean, as they say in Chicago
"He had it coming"
Vicious=
One year, ten thousand bad moments
But it was dressed up in heated emotion
And I tried to look for the best in the worst
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion
You're lucky I'm a private person
I've quietly carried your burden
And everyone thinks you're an angel
But shit, I would probably use different wording
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so vicious?
You like a certain type of woman
Who's smart but neglects intuition
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her
You just run to whoever is winning
Said that it was me and you for life
Now you're kinda actin' like I died
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so, so, so
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Half of me just can't resist it
Why you gotta be so vicious?
Why you gotta be so
Why you gotta be so vicious?
You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects
'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best
I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one
To take your love songs as a promise
Oh, you're so vicious
I loved you but I wish I didn't
If you're out there somewhere listenin'
Why you gotta be so vicious?
Read your Mind=
Made it clear when you told me (ah-ah)
Don't know why, but you gotta be lonely (ah, ah-ah)
Say it's hard, but you make it look easy (ah-ah)
So I'm trying to live in reality (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Decompressin', tryna ease the tension
But you got me stressin', feelin' like I need to call when
You sneak up on me, tell me that you miss me in your life
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
Tell me, what's gonna happen
When it's you and me in a room, but you know you can't have it?
Oh, I'll be laughin'
When you say that you really have changed
Finally found your way
'Cause I'm close to your face (ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
Double-checkin', did I get the message
In the way you intended? Got me second-guessin'
When you sneak up on me, tell me that you need me in your life
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call (want me at your beck and call)
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time (time)
To think (think) that we could be casual
You're not (you're not) my friend (my friend) and baby, you never were
Why (why) the fuss (fuss) if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
Tornado Warnings=
We were never in the park
Talking on a seesaw, teetering with our feelings in the dark
Ignoring tornado warnings
He didn't hold me in his arms
We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc
Ignoring tornado warnings
Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically, the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes
I guess maybe that's why
I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like
"I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think, somehow, in my mind
If I could convince him if he doesn't see it
Then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say
"I'm over that son of a bitch"
I'm lying to my therapist
I deserve an hour in a week
To focus on my thoughts
Not so obsessed with yours, I can't hear myself speak
I deserve my own consideration
Sometimes I wish I kept
Some of my feelings in the basement
So I'd still have some left
Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically, the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes
I guess maybe that's why
I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like
"I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think, somehow, in my mind
If I could convince him if he doesn't see it
Then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say
"I'm over that son of a bitch"
I'm lying to my therapist
I'll drive you home
You drive me crazy
But that's not gonna stop me
I'll call you out
You call me "baby"
But that's not gonna stop me
If I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like
"I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think, somehow, in my mind
If I could convince him if he doesn't see it
Then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say
"I'm over that son of a bitch"
I'm lying to my therapist
because i liked a boy=
I said I wanted thin mints and you said you knew a guy
You showed up with a boom box and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless
We bonded over black eyed peas and and complicated exes
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm a hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
I'm not catastrophizing
Everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close
While your heart was failing
It's not internet illusions just
two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love
But I'll always be your favorite
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm a hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
All because I liked a boy
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Dating boys with exes
No, I wouldn't recommend it
I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
And all of this for what?
When everything went down we'd already broken up
Please tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
All because I liked a boy
Already Over=
We been talking for hours
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end
Kissing after a conversation
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends
Same time here next weekend
Say, "We won't do this again"
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
Yeah, I say, "I'm done, " but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Selfishly don't wanna give you
Time to be on someone else's lips
But I'll take three short hours over three long weeks
Pretending like we don't exist, hmm
Same time here next weekend
Say, "We won't do this again"
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
Yeah, I say, "I'm done, " but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
After the aftermath, I know you'll be coming back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last
Of the aftermath, I know you'll be coming back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last time
I say, "I'm done, " but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Yeah, I like my bed, but it likes you, too
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
how many things=
You used a fork once
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere
There's no hidin' from the thought of us
I got ways to find you anywhere
We sat on the roof once
Conversation took us everywhere
And we talked until the sun came up
I wish we stayed just like we were up there
I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well established
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me
Remember when you left once
That never made too much sense to me
Well, it hurt you so bad, hurting me
You really came to me for sympathy
Oh, I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well established
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
And I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me
Am I'm not
Even a second thought?
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me
Wonder how many things
bet u wanna=
Told me, told me
I'm your only
It's all unfolding, babe
Slowly, slowly
Lies you sold me all saw the light of day
You been wasting time
On the other side
If your satisfied
Touché
Now you say you hate
All the empty space
And if you could go back, you'd stay
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there
Let me know what you found (let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
Chase me, chase me
That's right, baby, yeah
feel the way it feels
When you don't have control of who I'm holdin'
Is it feeding all your fears?
You been wasting time
On the other side
If your satisfied
Touché
But the lights are off
Your so-called friends are gone
Oh, I know what you're 'bout to say
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there
Let me know what you found (let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now

Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach

It's cold out there
Let me know what you found (let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna
Bet you miss me
Bet you're reminiscing
I bet you hate the way that you said goodbye
And you still can't even tell me why
I hate the way that you left me dry
But I'll keep that between you and I
I bet you didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now (oh, touch me now)
It's cold out there
Let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now (baby)
Bet you wanna love me now
Nonsense=
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "don't leave me alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, blee
I don't want no one else (don't want)
Baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
It's about you and me (me)
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Ooh, it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (ah)
I'm talkin' all around clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, blee
I don't want no one else (don't want)
Baby, I'm in too deep (too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
It's about you and me
I'll be honest (honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (when you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
Ooh, it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense (oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I don't even know anymore
This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make
Fast Times=
Sun's up too soon like daylight savings
Mixed emotions are congregatin'
Picturin' us in all these places
Ahead of myself's an understatement
Sky looks so purple, I can taste it
Couple days in, I call you, "Baby"
Three stories up here contemplatin'
But what the fuck is patience?
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
My feelings used to be serrated
But you speak in such a perfect cadence
Tiptoein' past so many stages
But what the fuck is patience?
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
These, these are
These are the fast times
These, these are
These are the
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yeah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
skinny dipping=
It'll be a Wednesday
And I'll be going in this coffee shop
Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name
And I look up from my phone
And think there's no chance it's you, but it is
You'll say, "Hi", I'll say, "Hi, how are you?"
You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?"
I'll say, "Shannon's being Shannon"
After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say
"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime"
And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on (hmm-mmm)
Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (hmm-mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't
We've been swimming on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but going down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?"
And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway"
We won't sit at our same old table, I promise
And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic
And we won't say it
But both of us, we'll be thinking about how different we are
From those scared little kids that had those (hmm-mmm)
Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (hmm-mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't
We've been swimming on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but going down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
We've been swimming on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but going down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
Bad for Business=
He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
We look good in photographs
I like the way you like to laugh at dirty jokes
I know they'll always land
Used to get work on time
But now you're taking up my nights
Never been so glad to be so tired
Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ahh, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin'
He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
If I'm just writing happy songs
Will anybody sing along?
You had to go and break into my head
And I would try to fight these feelings
I can't find a single reason
I'd make all the same mistakes again, ohh
Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ahh, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin'
He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
He's good (good), it's bad (bad)
The best I've ever had (best I've ever had)
And he's so nice, it's sad (it's sad)
He ruined all my plans
And he just makes me so crazy
I know everyone sees
That he'll be the death of me
He's good for my heart but he's bad for business (he's very bad for business)
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
He's good for my heart but he's bad for business (so bad)
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
decode=
You're good at the falling, not the staying there
You're good at the giving too much then getting scared
You're good at impersonating someone who cares
And you had me for a minute there
But now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Re-read every single undertone and I
Overanalyzed it, front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in the gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode
There's a weight off my shoulders now that I don't chase you
Being myself, did that emasculate you?
Learning from you that I can walk away, too
And you had me for a minute, too
But now I wonder why
I let your indecision keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Unpacked every single word you wrote and I
Overanalyzed it, front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in the gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode
There's nothing left here to decode
Now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Re-read every single undertone and I
Overanalyzed it, front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in the gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode
There's nothing, there's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing left here to decode
There's nothing, there's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing left here to decode
(I wanna make a video to our future selves)
opposite=
Oh, so you do have a type?
And it's not me
Oh, so you can reply?
Just to not me
If you wanted brown eyes
I could have got contacts
So y'all are in Paris now?
Guess it's public
Face like that other girl
You're in love with
You knew I would see that
You knew I would notice
She looks nothing like me
Can't really tell, should I be
Tryna take it as a compliment?
It's kinda feeling like the opposite
She looks nothing like me
So why do you look so happy?
Now I think I get the cause of it
You were holding out to find the opposite
And I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Oh, I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Does she say nothing so you feel good?
Does she step out of the spotlight so you bathe in it?
Does she get up on top of you more than I would?
Does she just love the picture 'cause you're painting it?
I care but I don't
Just wondering when you
Said I'm beautiful
Was I being lied to?
She looks nothing like me
Can't really tell, should I be
Tryna take it as a compliment?
It's kinda feeling like the opposite
She looks nothing like me
So why do you look so happy?
Now I think I get the cause of it
You were holding out to find the opposite
And I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Oh, I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway (end up with her anyway)
End up with her anyway
Feather=
Oh, it's like that
I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you (for you)
Then you pulled back
Wanna try to make plans more than two hours in advance, hm-mmm
I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind
Floating through the memories like, whatever, you're a waste of time
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, send a pic
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you out my life
With you out my life
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
It feels so good not caring where you are tonight
And it feels so good not pretending to like the wine you like
I slam the door (slam the door), I hit ignore (hit ignore)
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk
I, I'm so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind
Floating through the memories like, whatever, you're a waste of time
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, send a pic
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you out my life
With you out my life
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather
You want me, I'm done
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I'm done)
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind)
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind)
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah)
Lonesome=
If I fall in love with all my problems, will they leave me too?
Well, maybe I believed in all your lies, 'cause I believed in you
Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know, you know, it keeps me up
Did you think about her face with your hands around my waist?
Did you even give a fuck?
You can't spell lonesome without me
And there's no hope in misery
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell lonesome without me, you just can't
Tell me I was more than just a decent opportunity
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear to control how you're perceived?
Oh, why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know, you know, it keeps me up
Isn't it kind of strange how it all changed when
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love
You can't spell lonesome without me
And there's no hope in misery
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell lonesome without me, you just can't
things i wish you said=
Baby, sorry I left you in the dark
I always reach for your leg over there on your side of the car
Baby, everything reminds me of you
Nobody gets my jokes, everyone here thinks I'm fuckin' rude
When I saw you cry, I didn't handle it well
Without you here I don't know what to do with myself
I think about these things at night
Before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
Things like, "Darling, I hope you know it scared me to death
The night that your sister said that you got in an accident
And, "God I, I'm watching everything that you do
I can't get your songs out of my head, or your hair out of my room"
I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell
That I can't even stomach loving somebody else
I think about these things at night
Before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
I'm sorry that I pulled the "it's not you, it's me"
One day I'll make sure you get a real apology
I'll waste my time, I'll waste my life on idiotic things
Like things you never said, things you'll never say to me
