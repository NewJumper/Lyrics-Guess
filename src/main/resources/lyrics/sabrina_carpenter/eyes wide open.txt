Eyes Wide Open
12
Eyes Wide Open=
Everybody loves to tell me, I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
Gotta make him proud
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open (yeah)
All I have is just this moment
And I don't want to miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way (make my way)
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open
Keep my eyes wide open
Can't Blame a Girl for Trying=
Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated
I should've played it cool, instead I made a fool
Oh, the things I do
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh
I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh no no
And I think sometimes I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Do what I do
And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one and it's so intoxicating
Being where I've been I know that in the end
I'll do it all again
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying, hm oh
The Middle of Starting Over=
Cast, out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now, that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me
Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe
Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
Alone, in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now, this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah
As hard as it seems
I'll hold my breath and just believe
Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
The colors and the stars
Seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away (not far away)
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending
Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
We'll Be The Stars=
We are young, we are gold
Trying things we didn't know
Looking at the sky
See it come alive
All our fears became our hopes
Climbed out every locked window
We rode a lion's mane
And fell upon the rain
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
Let me in
Hold me close
Fill my heart with simple notes
So when it's hard to see
They are there reminding me
Take my breath and hold me high
So I can feel the city lights
Glowing under me
It's in our reach, we're breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
All we really need is us
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
We'll be the stars
Woah, we'll be the stars
Two Young Hearts=
It's a narrow line I'm walkin'
Better watch myself
'Cause we got everybody talkin'
And I can hear 'em say
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind (My mind)
And yes I know what love is
'Cause we are two old souls,
With two young hearts
We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever,
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls,
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
They say we're too young
I could lie awake in darkness
Oh just to dream of you
And you could lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds
And yes we know what love is
'Cause we are two old souls,
With two young hearts
We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever,
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls,
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
We're gonna keep on runnin'
Runnin' for all that we are
We want it all or nothing
We knew it right from the start
We are apart of something
Something as old as time, time, time
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever,
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls,
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
You're never too young
Your Love's Like=
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out, caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go, troubles never break through
The grass is greener, my head is clearer
I got peace of mind when I fall into your eyes
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight,
Dancing in the moonlight
That what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
Stop signs, I keep on runnin' into
Red lights make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be only you and me all the time
In a world no one can find
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight,
Dancing in the moonlight
That what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
When life has left me numb
And I need a pick me up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love, your love
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soaking in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love,
That's what your love's like
That's what your love's like
Too Young=
Big lights
People
Rushing to grow up before you know
Stop signs
Denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind
If I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
And if I'm too young
To know anything
Why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
Rain drops
Deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing
Running
To a place where nobody says no
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly
If I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young
To know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
And if I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
And if I'm too young
To know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
'Cause I'm not too young
Seamless=
Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend till the end
My better half no pretend
Our language is sacred
No people try to solve it
New adventures on the way
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Woah oh, yeah, woah oh
We're klutzy, but so lucky
That I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime
You're stuck with me your whole life
So different, out of our minds
From a planet that's hard to find
Every second every day
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
You're right by my side whenever I need you
Through the hardest times
I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn when the moon is gone
I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah we're seamless
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Right Now=
We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you, put your camera down
Take a shot, give it all you got
I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward, always looking back
They seemed so near, but they're not here
'Cause time moves on so quickly, without or with me
I've got to take a breath
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself, I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last, right now
Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels?
When you're nervous or excited 'cause it's getting real
Have you stopped to listen to what's in your soul?
That's your intuition and it always knows
Time moves on so quickly, without or with me
I've got to take a breath
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself, I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now (now)
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last, right now
Right now (right now)
Right now (right now)
Enjoy the ride
The ride that you're on right now
Right now
Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last, right now
Darling I'm a Mess=
This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
And most times I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend
Yeah I'll try to make our hearts beat in time,
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine
But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
Your lips on this
'Cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget, all that you said is engraved in my head
Yeah I'll try to make our hearts beat in time,
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine
But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is, one more goodbye kiss
A goodbye kiss
Yeah I'll try to make our hearts beat in time,
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine
But darling I'm a mess without your love (Without your love)
Heaven knows I'm trying (Woah)
Trying to get by (No, no, no, no, no, no)
But darling I'm a mess without your love,
All I need is one (one more) more goodbye (goodbye) kiss
White Flag=
Take, take it all away, save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone, and I'm all alone with the dial tone
Wait, wait 'til the sun is up, drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out, wanna beg for luck, but I'm way too proud, never giving up
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
Give, give everything I've got, out of reach, but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot, feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run, run, running like a fool, never win if you never lose
And find hope and a little truth
Gonna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
Best Thing I Got=
So what if I just wanna be a little bit out of my mind
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I happen to be
A little bit out of my mind
I better steal your heart and you'll like it
And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
I know sometimes, it seems like I am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I am just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it
But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
So don't feel lonely tonight
You know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind
You know I'll never be too hard to find
I know sometimes, it seems like I am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
