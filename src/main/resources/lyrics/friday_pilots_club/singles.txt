End of It=
It's cruel you know
The way they've been treating you lately
Get you real messed up on the daily
They tell you things you want
To hear they say, well
Honey, lover, what would I do without you?
But at the end of the day it's a game
So many mouths and they're
Moving the same way
But you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast
I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
It's what you give that's got
Me locked up feeling hazy
I cut all the lines but it's crazy
So I say what I, what I always say like
Is it what you want? Is it what you need?
Is there something else you needed from me?
Try to take a collar to a dog with no owner
Tell him sit, lay down
Roll over it's strange
I'm caught up, I'm lost in the game
I move while they beg me to stay
And I've been feeling broke up since I
Woke up but it's a new day
When I say what I needed, needed to say
And you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
Tides turn as bridges burn
There's a road being cut through the thick
You hate me, you love me
Your friends want to cut me
But it's all the same, ain't it?
It's the same way and you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
It's the same way but you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've
Been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it
I'm not at the end of it
No, no i'm not at the end of it
No, no i'm not at the end of it
Bad As Hell=
All this shade but no tea
I'm growing thirsty here in all this heat
Honey, I'm lost but
These people got me caught up
What it seems like they need
They always want me but never wanna please
Where you going after? Whatcha need now?
Well this vice, this sweet temptation
The answer to frustration
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me
Well my girl, she's bad as hell
You know a little fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell
So much to give and she knows it too
And there's so much to say about
A girl with nothing to prove
She's in my head now telling me just how
She's my vice, my sweet temptation
Make me question my salvation
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me
Well my girl, she's bad as hell
You know a little fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell
This vice, this sweet temptation
The answer to frustration
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me
My girl, she's bad as hell
You know we're all fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Oh lord, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell
Bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell yeah, she's bad
Would You Mind=
Ignition on this wonderful
Night of submission
Promises break when she's away from home
Can I listen for the drag
Of the hands towards fission?
She's losing battles to tempting
Shadows when she's alone
For all that I know
You needed someone else to help
You forget the reason
You fell for me at all
In this hell of a season
If I spend the night in
The gaze of strange eyes
Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?
Been tasting this sweet little lie from Eden
She reached the bruised
Forbidden fruit with such ease
While she's wasting away she'll
Say there's no meanin'
To his touch, to his love
But she still needs to blame it on me
Did you need somebody else to
Help you forget the reason
That you fell for me at all
In this hell of a season?
If I spend the night in
The gaze of strange eyes
Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?
Look I get it you ain't friends with the
Monsters in your head i too am a sinner
But my sins ain't in your bed
You said before you felt lonely
So how does it feel now
That you don't own me?
'Cause if you needed someone else to
Help you fight off your demons
You're just a body, just a shell
Just a heart that stopped beating
So when I spent the night in
The gaze of strange eyes would you mind?
Oh, tell me would you mind?
Oh, would you mind?
Yes I know that you'll mind
Gold and Bones=
So what if I'm wasted
Or dreaming, baby don't go changing
Let me feel the light
Let me feel
Tonight she's wearing gold and bones and eager eyes
I already know, I already know that I can't fight
She makes me wanna do wrong
She makes being bad feel so damn right
But not in this light
Cause she says she'll change but I don't want that
Matter fact I'll never look back
Your change ain't gonna cure what ails me
Maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
Once for I feel alive
Cause hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted
God I'm satisfied
And for the thousandth time
You can walk all over me
As we toe the line
Between feeling alive and feeling fine
But I won't beg and I won't look back
Cause somewhere deep I know you want that
I'm patient but patience ain't what gonna make it alright
Maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, but don't go changing
Once for I feel alive
Cause hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted
God I'm satisfied
Satisfied
Let me feel
So, maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, but don't go changing
For once I feel alive
Cause hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted
God I'm satisfied
PRBLM=
I got a problem
My name's been going around
'Cause people wanna run their mouths yeah, yeah
But I can't stop them
'Cause I can't stop myself
From giving them these stories to tell
I can't stand to be alone
Caught up on my phone
Just some boy that they would never really talk to
I just need another soul, not someone to control
Just someone that I can give a mind to
But is it better, living in the weather of the young? (Of the young)
Oh, is it cooler? Short-lived but it's warmer than above
Is it ever, ever enough?
While you were talking
They just get me tired
So I cut the slack while you're throwing it back, never asking "Are you mine?"
You know I'm never home
But the more she knows the more I show
Of my head, my heart, these bleeding cards all over the table
And I end up in this roll
I never told them what I'm told
Don't wanna be force fed, sordid, I don't wanna be stable
If its better, living in the weather of the young (Of the young)
Oh, is it cooler? Short-lived but it's warmer than above
Is it ever, ever enough?
Didn't really think that it would work this way
Guess I just sort of woke up
Gettin' comfy in these games we play, oh I used to give so much
I'mma spend it all on a perfect picture of imperfect woes
(And if you wanna) Meet me in the bathroom, you say "That's gross, okay let's go"
To your place
(Didn't really think that it would work this way)
(Guess I just sort of woke up)
A weary pace
(Gettin' comfy in these games we play, oh I used to give too much)
With the taxi shadow, the taxi shadow
(I'mma spend it all on a perfect picture of imperfect woes)
Oh lord I know
(Meet me in the bathroom)
(You say "That's gross")
"Okay let's go!"
Where it's better, living in the weather of the young (Of the young)
Oh, is it cooler? Short-lived but it's warmer than above
Is it ever, ever enough?
[Outro]
Hey, it's uh, it's me, again (Oh lord, I know it's more than enough)
I uh, I'm sorry about earlier, I just
I don't know it was just one of those weird times
And y'know, we're both there at the bar
And just, yeah
I'm sorry, I'm really fucking sorry, just call me (Is it ever, ever enough?)
Glory=
Sovereignty up on a hill
Shooting guns and passing bills
Promising the world could be alright
If these people, these sheep
Could just quit and believe
In the system of pretending that everything is fine
Whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes
When the good
When the good die young
Take another, a sister or brother
You're egging me on
If you take the only ones who’d care when I'm gone
I'm too angry to sleep
Too tired to keep runnin’
But I'm wanted by a god
Who's so afraid of death, he's starting to become it
Oh power, power
A hero calls
From the bottom of a bottle (bottle)
Watch him fall
Let whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes
When the good
When the good die young
Give me power, power
A hero calls
From bottom of a bottle (bottle)
Watch him fall
Whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes
When the good
When the good die young
(Glory!)
When they die young
When the good die young
When the good die young
Heartbreak Beat=
On a heartbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got
Yeah, there's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
Yeah, there's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
And there's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
When the beat don't stop
And we talk so tough
There's a perfect kiss
Somewhere out in the dark
But a kiss ain't enough
And the world don't stop
(Don't stop, don't stop)
Every time that you call
(Every time that you call)
And the world don't stop
(Don't stop)
Every time that you call
There's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on our street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
I'm a heartbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got
Yeah, there's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
There's a heartbreak beat
Lips Like Sugar=
She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight
You'll flow down her river
She'll ask you, you'll give her
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
And melt into this lake
You'll flow down her river
But you'll never give her
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
Alone on the river
Mirror kisses
Mirror kisses
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
Lips like sugar (Sugar)
Sugar kisses (Kisses)
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

Sugar kisses
Lips like
Oh, lips like

Got to dance like a fool
Got the message that I got to be
A wild one
Ooh yeah, I'm a wild one

Look Better In Gold=
Bet it'd look better in gold
But the price too high till the second it's sold
It's sold
And it shows
Ask what you already know
But the kids don't do
What the kids get told

And it goes
If I could say
Just what I wanna
Betcha would change
Betcha you're gonna (but)
It stays the same

What I've been sold
Been sold

All work no play
And Johnny feels old
Or maybe grows cold
Who even knows

Couse money only moves when the kids are saying

Change For You=
22 and oh lord I'm seeing red
I bought a gun last night
Cause god I'm afraid of death
Oh and I never say no
Never stay home
Never wanna stop
But I don't wanna go
Sorry if I'm shady, lately

Wasting away
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Too late for me to come around
Oh and I'm so fucked up
And everybody's bringing me down
Oh is it all about me

All about always wanting more
Always want more, more

Of saying the same thing
With nothing to lose

Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away

So call me back or call me out
My head's in the clouds
But now I'm bringing you down

Right when I turn away

Start feeling so low
Can't say that I don't, no
All these words
They ain't my own
Yeah I don't know
Why I never let go

Cut Me Up=
The storied scar is painted black
One step forward and two steps back
The pieces fit but something's missing
The hole in my throat is saving me
I can say what I want but not what I need
My coffin' mouth, my gagged intention
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, I don't feel
Practice the art of saving face
While blacking out at the masquerade
There's plenty, of cause, but no intention, no intention
Did we care enough?
To ever call it love? Call it love? (Would you ever?)
Cut it off if someone calls it out?
Would you call it out?
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, I don't feel right...
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
Cut me up in the middle of the night
I keep my mouth shut
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
'Cause baby, it don't feel right
Breaking My Bones=
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars
To come down
All of the stars
To come down
Foxglove to the heartbeat
Online with a clean sheet
Been over loved
Lost my touch
Punch out and repeat
Short game in the long run
Got spread like a shotgun
Say I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm singing
Give it away, give 'em a taste
Yeah, you got nothing to lose
Pick up the pace
Put on a face
It's all about you, yeah
It's all about you
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars
To come down
All of the stars
To come down
And we fashion our souls
For the likes of a ghost
For all of the stars
To come down
Yeah, all of the stars
To come down
Let's talk
Happiness or vanity
Where do you find your clarity?
How do you get off, who do you call God?
Never mind, just stare at me
Let it kill you, then tell all your friends
Pretty people make the pages of the DSM
Give it away, give 'em a taste
Yeah, you got nothing to lose
Pick up the pace
Put on a face
It's all about you, yeah
It's all about you
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars

All of the stars
To come down
And we fashion our soul
For the likes of a ghost
For all of the stars

Down
Come by, come back, come down
Down
Come by, come back, come down

I've been breaking my bones (come by, come back, come down, down)
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars
To come down
All of the stars
To come down
Glad To Be Here=
Appreciation comes after the fight
Appreciation for the darkest colors in my life
The darkest grays and all the shades of blue
The thousand times I thought that I
Would never be seeing you again
But I can't
I can't pretend
I'm always on the mend
There's forks in the road forcing colors to blend
When the medication fails me, know that I use
The fact that I'm just glad to be here
I'm just glad to be here with you
Thankful for the things that we forget
My head works like a hearse
So what is there to miss
About biting back the hand that feeds
Just to feel some urgency
Just to know that I can bleed
Just to know that
I can't pretend
I'm always on the mend
There's forks in the road forcing colors to blend
When the medication fails me, know that I use
The fact that I'm just glad to be here
I'm just glad to be here with you
So, let me fall if you must
I'm fine
And I know I'm like this all the time
This is just the way I'm designed
This is just the way that I'm designed
How I can't pretend
I'm always on the mend
There's forks in the road forcing colors to blend
When the medication fails me, know that I use
The fact that I'm just glad to be here
I'm just glad that
I can't pretend
I'm always on the mend
There's forks in the road forcing colors to blend
When the medication fails me, know that I use
The fact that I'm just glad to be here
I'm just glad to be here with you
With you
With you
To be here with you
For The Wicked=
Is there one more bar
Or one more mistake
To bring me back down?
I've just been hanging at home anyway
Stuck in the mud
I should get away from you, baby
Wait, it's too late
Don't cry, don't wait for me
Don't pray for me
A little space is all I need
Yeah, I think it's all I need
'Cause
Vanity's for the wicked, yeah
Could you miss me now that I'm burning down?
Petty things for the wicked, but
Do you want me now that I'm burning out?
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm burning out, yeah
Give me a blue morning
Maybe an amber afternoon
Effortless optimism
I think you might've left too soon
'Cause I won't cry, I won't wait for you
My baby blue
Maybe space is what we need
Yeah, I think it's what we need
'Cause I just wanna sink
Vanity's for the wicked, yeah
Could you miss me now that I'm burning down?
Petty things for the wicked, but
Do you want me now that I'm burning out?
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm burning out, yeah
A hole in the ground or a talk of the town
Where does your throne lie?
The arrow and doe, the guest and its host
Dance as we collide (we collide)
A hole in the ground or a talk of the town
Where does your throne lie? (As we collide)
The arrow and doe, the guest and its host
Dance as we collide
Vanity's for the wicked, yeah
Could you miss me now that I'm burning down?
Petty things for the wicked, but
Do you want me now that I'm burning out?
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm-
'Cause honey, I'm burning out, yeah
('Cause honey, I'm burning out, yeah)
Hot Mess=
She's a hot mess, 150 down the highway in a sundress
Watch her burn it up, I'm bearing witness
'Cause if she said that I look better, down the barrel of a Beretta
Oh, I couldn't protest
Reckless don't mean a thing if you ain't kinda hopeless
As she told me not to waste another moment
No point resisting giving up control
Ah, I'm giving up control
Oh, I want it, but you don't know how to let it go
I got it, but you know I never wanna know
I have it, have to draw the knife, I bet I won't
(Does anyone have to know?)
You got me on the way out, honey, on the way down
You're so personal, call it how you see it
Tell me that you need it (does anyone have to know?)
Better when we're tongue-tied than bitter on a bad night
You say it's not personal, what's the point of leaving?
Almost off the deep end (does anyone have to know?)
(Does anyone have to know?)
So what's a comeback without just a little bit of combat?
Clawing up my back, oh, would you want that?
Would you slip the pill, would you run the blade right through?
Just for the contact
"Fuck that", she says as she throws another shot back
No sweet talk, let's just play it abstract
What's love but the price of being sold?
Oh, I'm giving up control
Oh, I want it, but you don't know how to let it go
I got it, but you know I never wanna know
I have it, have to draw the knife, I bet I won't
(What's the line? It's something like, uh)
You got me on the way out, honey, on the way down
You're so personal, call it how you see it
Tell me that you need it (does anyone have to know?)
Better when we're tongue-tied than bitter on a bad night
You say it's not personal, what's the point of leaving?
Almost off the deep end (does anyone have to know?)
Get too close, and I'm giving up control
Jump my bones, tell me what I wanna know
Do things I won't, so I could never let you go
Yeah, baby, every time, yeah
Get too close, and I'm giving up control
Jump my bones, tell me what I wanna know
Make me promise I won't ever tell a soul
(Does anyone have to know?)
You got me on the way out, honey, on the way down
You're so personal, call it how you see it
Tell me that you need it (does anyone have to know?)
Better when we're tongue-tied than bitter on a bad night
You say it's not personal, what's the point of leaving?
Almost off the deep end (does anyone have to know?)
Better With=
My, my
Baby, know that I need
Just what you want from me
Can't lie
Oh, what should I do?
I'm likin' it better with you
Ooh
I'm likin' it better with you
What would your mother say
If she knew the little saint
You aren't
Just want a little taste
Before throwing the plate away
I hear the door close
Yeah, we both know
Where this goes
I don't know what to say
But I'm feeling wide awake
Burning through the breaks
My, my
Baby, know that I need
Just what you want from me
Can't lie
Oh, what should I do?
I'm likin' it better with you
I'm finding it hard to speak
The ghost writer bargaining
Luck of a kennedy
Don't know what came over me
Turn of thе knife, flick of the light
Word of the night is
It's right thеre in front of me
It's right there in front of me
Burning through the breaks
My, my
Baby, know that I need
Just what you want from me
Can't lie
Oh, what should I do?
I'm likin' it better with you
My, my
Baby, know that I need
Just what you want from me
Can't lie
Oh, what should I do?
I'm likin' it better with you
My, my
Baby, know that I need
Just what you want from me
Can't lie
Oh, what should I do?
I'm likin' it better with you
Never Say No=
Clenching my jaw as she slips me her neck
Does she care that I called?
Has she started to recognize me there
Against her, never with her?
And do you think that she minds
Every text that I miss, every excuse I give
Every time I've ripped right through her
Like I never knew her
'Cause I never did
But she snaps right back
I'll never say no
Just a twenty-something
Who never lets go
It's all or nothing for you, I won't
I'll never say, no I'll never say
I'm hoping it's you too, as I scorch in LA
Know I won't wither without you, give myself away
Where's the meaning in this fleeting age?
It's a vicious path but it's all we have
I'll never say no
Just a twenty-something
Who never lets go
It's all or nothing for you, I won't
I'll never say, no I'll never say
Because I'm so far from the one
Just some zero who don't know what he wants
So gone, tell me, what do you want?
Because I'm watching you save my life
Every other night I'll try to put this lightly
But why
I'll never say no
Just a twenty-something
Who never lets go
It's all or nothing for you, I won't
I'll never say, no I'll never say no
Poison or Patience (feat. OSTON)=
Poison or patience to make me okay
Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself
Waking up's a rip off
I could be asleep but instead
I'm here pissed off
Thinkin bout a time that
I said something dumb
Shoulda caught a fat lip and then some
Maybe that would make me feel better?
Throwing up my error and I
Put it under pressure take it back
No chance, no way, never no hope, too late
Poison or patience to make me okay
Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself today i hate myself today
I don't wanna be upset anymore
Body far from my head
Spiral on the bedroom floor
I'm circling the drain, better slow it down
Fuck it never mind watch me go around
And momma I'm an internet hero
Don't pay a therapist I got my 1s and my 0s
To keep me company when I'm feeling low
Oh god I can't afford to be original
So it's poison or patience to make me okay
Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself today i hate myself today
I hate myself today i hate myself today
Oh god I hate myself today
I paid the price for change
I learned to bare the weight
Now I'm selling out for pain
And I hate myself today
Bury Me=
What you don't see is
The line that we've been riding
What you don't know won't kill ya but it's trying so hard
And I've been feeling caught up
I lost the god that's holdin' me down
Short your position to listen to the sound of
You falling out
Don't let me down
And I wont it let it out
Don't change the tune
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me how I'm supposed to know
When all you do is tease
So I'll tell you what I want
Cause I know what you see
While I'm stuck here under you
Go ahead and bury me
Took shape in the shade
My little wraith
Fear the spectre of your youth
Really your call though isn't it, doll?
If it's your verdict, who needs proof?
Why try and save
All that we made
When the machine has made it clear
I'm going down
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me how I'm supposed to know
When all you do is tease
So I'll tell you what I want
Cause I know what you see
While I'm stuck here under you
Go ahead and bury me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me how I'm supposed to know
When all you do is tease
So I'll tell you what I want
Cause I know what you see
While I'm stuck here under you
Go ahead and bury me
IDWBS=
Do I seem strange?
Like a solipsistic nihilist with no shame
In always getting his way?
I'm just playing the game
Courageous and intoxicated
Will I feel the pain
Of a come down?
I've never known my needs
I'm praying for a better body
While there's somebody feeding on all the things I'm preaching
The gospel calls for blood
You wanna take it (Take it)
And call me the holy one
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Everything rots in the sun
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Singing just to be sung
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
I don't wanna be someone, but I
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Does it seem broke?
Or am I just punchlining some sinister joke
The plot is smoked
Let the credits roll
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Everything rots in the sun
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Singing just to be sung
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
I don't wanna be someone, but I
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Always want more
Always want more
Always want more
More more more
Everything rots in the sun
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
Singing just to be sung
Gotta feeling I don't wanna be someone
I don't wanna be someone, but I
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Always want more
Gotta get yours
If you want more
Cut it
Spit it out
Show em you deserve it
Life Support=
It's been 4 months since you left me
But it's been 2 minutes since you called
Say I've been acting like the old me
Yeah you've been acting like you'd know
Tell me
Tell me what you want from me
Darlin
Tell me what you need to see
Medicate yourself on control
All the while
I'm dying just to let you go
Yeah you keep me
Down, good lord, just go and cut the cord
I told you
I don't need your life support
No not anymore
It's been 4 months since you left me
It's been 4 months since I moved on
And I could feel a certain way about the things you used to say
But as I said, I've moved on
Tell me
Tell me what you want from me
Darlin
Tell me what you need to see
Medicate yourself on control
All the while
I'm dying just to let you go
Yeah you keep me
Down, good lord, just go and cut the cord
I told you
I don't need your life support
No not anymore
No not anymore
It's been 4 months since you left me
It's been forever since I cared
Medicate yourself on control
All the while
I'm dying just to let you go
Yeah you keep me
Down, good lord, just go and cut the cord
I told you
I don't need your life support
No not anymore
No not anymore
Ms. Supernova=
I find it hard
Coming back down
When I'm this far out
Searching for a constellation
That we called home
Don't mind
Lift off
It gets a little shaky on the way up, but
That's just another conversation
That I'll let go
I'll let it all go
Call ground control
Let 'em know
Yeah, it's time to cut the motor
As I move closer
So what's the point of closure?
Countdown's over
Yeah it's been real nice to know ya
Ms. Supernova
Cosmic
Croonin'
Singing my way past the moon and
Back
If I never hear a sound
What kind of life is that
Float on
Detach
Bracing myself for the impact
For the impact
Call ground control
Let 'em know
Yeah it's time to cut the motor
As I move closer
So what's the point of closure?
Countdown's over
Yeah it's been real nice to know ya
Ms. Supernova
Call ground control
Let 'em know
Yeah it's time to cut the motor
As I move closer
So what's the point of closure?
Countdown's over
Yeah it's been real nice to know ya
Ms. Supernova
I find it hard
Coming back down
When I'm this far
Out
