Infinity=
Was it all in my head?
In an empty bed
And I told you that I need you
Baby, can't you see I'm alone? Oh-oh
I was lost in my feet
On an empty street
So I saved your seat infinity
Forever figures five and three
You know, oh, oh
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should have been
Oh, my lady, can I have this dance? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My lady (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Was it hard to believe?
Wear your heart on my sleeve
And I'll hold you when you're lonely
When you're cold 'cause you're the only girl for me
Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should have been
Oh, my lady, can I have this dance? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My lady (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should have been
Oh, my lady, can I have this dance?
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should have been
Oh, my lady, can I have this dance? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Can I have this dance?) my lady (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it
I'm Ready=
Are you ready
You're feeling good, you're feeling right
Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind
Baby girl, looking fine
Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys
Catch my stare, little smile
Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe
Someday I'll be so damn sublime,
We'll arrive behind a hash-tag sign
I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight,
Set this shit on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight,
Set this shit on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
Are you ready?
I'm ready
Break me down, dirty jokes
Watch me dear, and say what you wanna know
Beauty lies, within the eyes
Of the beholder, I'll be holding you close all night
I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight,
Set this shit on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight,
Set this shit on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
Are you ready?
I'm ready
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
I'm ready
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Are you ready?
My Calling=
Oh father, father, I'm a dreamer (a dreamer)
We dream of green, but now we're gray
Up on a hill, down by the river (the river)
That river took my girl away
And I wonder, is something in the water make me wanting more?
Make me wanting more
A heartbreak and a hundred red balloons, now I'm off the floor
So here I go
I'm coming up, it might be my calling, my calling
I'm coming up, it might be my time
I'm taking off, you might say I'm all in, I'm all in
I'll send a postcard from the sky
My calling, my calling
My calling, my calling
Oh, Cleopatra was a lover (a lover)
But this world of mine is turning green
I'm sailing by the clouds above her (above her)
I'm finding out what all this means
And I wonder, is something in the water make me wanting more?
Make me wanting more
A heartbreak and a hundred red balloons, now I'm off the floor
So here I go
I'm coming up, it might be my calling, my calling
I'm coming up, it might be my time

My calling, my calling
My calling, my calling
And I wonder, is something in the water make me wanting more?

My calling, my calling
Thirsty=
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
I'm up and I raise my cup, singing everything is gold
Crew neck and a white blank check
I'll be moving on my own
I walked on sippin' on that love
It's another bumpy road
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home (yo-de-lay-hee-hoo)
I run my mouth
Don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire
Could burn my heart away
We are young
But we can make it rain
It's thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
I'm up and I raise my cup, see 'em bouncin' on the floor
Perfume in a hotel room
We go bouncin' back for more (yo-de-lay-hee-hoo)
One us sippin' on that fun
It's a feeling we adore
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home (yo-de-lay-hee-hoo)
I run my mouth
Don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire
Could burn my heart away
We are young
But we can make it rain
It's thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday (hey)
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
It's thirsty, thirsty Thursday (thirsty, thirsty Thursday)
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
(we're so thirsty)
(can't no one stop me)
(keep on bouncin')
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Pitchfork Kids=
I didn't know her, couldn't hold her, bones didn't settle in
She's gotta have it, gotta have it oh with her hipster friends
Ooh, ooh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid
Ooh, ooh, and there's more where she lives
And why should I spend time running for my life?
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
The moon is upon us, gaining on us
She's crossed there, to stay
We had to part, couldn't break her heart 'cause their blood pumps through her veins
Ooh, ooh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid
Ooh, ooh, and there's more where she lives
And why should I spend time running for my life?
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
And why should I spend time running for my life?
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
Woody Allen=
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Called you up so we could reminisce
About the old days, gold days,
How we've been.
The city's rusty after what we did.
We did, we did, we did.
Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records,
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store,
And now I'm shaking (shaking)
Waiting (waiting)
As you come say hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Every time I get the urge to go,
I'm the king of the island on a rusty throne.
Who the f**k wants to rule, ruling all alone, alone, alone, alone.
Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records,
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store,
And now I'm hoping (hoping)
Wishing (wishing)
As I walk you to your door (your door, your door, your door, your door)
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
And when the weekend comes around,
Make our way through rusty towns.
Lift the weight up off your back,
You're with me, love, just relax.
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Livin' on Love=
You said marriage has a nice ring to it
And my jaw dropped down like the kick drum knew it
(I can't stop and let you go
Baby, I gotta mind to let you know)
I'm not one to take it fast
I go the best seat back in history class
(One lass chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel)
Sayin' You
You make me feel so brand new
What can I do?
Let's toast the one's who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
'Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we've got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
(Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love)
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin on love
We'll be found in Frankie's town
And tell the world we're gonna shake the ground
One last chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel
Sayin' You
You make me feel so brand new (oh oh oh)
What can I do?
Let's toast the one's who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
'Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we've got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
(Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love)
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
Hey! You're the one I wait for
Wait each and every day for
Baby, laugh, rhythm all around us
Sweet love, it finally found us
You baby girl
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
Big White Bed=
All I want is you, my dear
We will live up on the tree
In a big white house, in a big white bed
Darling, this is not the end
All I want is you, my dear
We will live up on the tree
In a big white house, in a big white bed
Darling, this is not the end
Watching clouds overhead
Here she lies in her bed
There's a long day ahead
She is lost in her bed
Watching clouds overhead
Here she lies in her bed
There's a long day ahead
She is lost in her bed
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
The World Is a Marble Heart=
The world is a marble heart
Too fragile, too broken
Left without nothing but our backs to hold on to
You're out in the daylight
And out of the jungle
We could have been, we should have been
What your heart couldn't handle
Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me
I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start
And now you can't go breaking my heart (woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart
The world is a marble heart
It's bullshit and we know it
Like a flower sheltered in stone
With no chance of regrowing
Like push comes to shove
Like I'm out on your doorstep
We could have been, we should have been
With only my soul left
Feel like I need (woah oh), to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me
I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start
And now you can't go breaking my heart (yeah ah ah, woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart
Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't
And now you can't go breaking my heart
I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start
And now you can't go breaking my heart (yeah ah ah, woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart
The Green and the Town=
A year from now, we won't be pretty
A year from now, we won't be young
But we will live among the giants
Before the giants learn to run
Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home
We would sail across the ocean
If cloudy skies should take our friends
And we will learn from the giants
Before the giants learn from them
Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home
What can I say, without a say?
We've got a way to go, and what can I do
To get back to you, and help us to find a home
To search the green and town
A year from now, we won't be lovers
We'll just be suits and ties and shoes
And we will grow without our parents
'Cause soon we will be giants too
Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home
What can I say, without a say?
We've got a way to go, and what can I do
To get back to you, and help us to find a home
To search the green and town
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you
Big Idea=
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
I've seen almost every side of the industry
Except the side we've been working seven years to see
Just some kids with pro tools and a mic and a big idea, but no IDs
So bar scenes weren't an option
Ukulele DJs
Only band in the genre
And we're dreaming of Bahamas
So pass around the bottle
Good music's still good even if no one is watching
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
John's too big to fail
Make it superstar
His label's doing the thing and we were doing ours
Shame painted the discotheque
I was feeling kind of alone till I heard that track, oh
And now we celebrate
If only for today
No story's a fairytale
I don't know if we'll make it
But we're not too big to fail
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Pro tools and a mic and a big idea
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
You can do anything you want
Growing Old on Bleecker Street=
No point in dreaming if you're alone
No point in walking without the road
No point in crying without that someone there beside you
Saying it will be OK
I'll take my time
I'll take my time
You cannot rush
What can't be timed
And its tough believing
There's someone living out there
Happier than me
Happier than me
We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be
I woke up last night from a dream
That we'd grow old on Bleecker Street
Sit by the fire and I'd play my guitar
But dreams are only dreams
And then I wonder when we leave
Will the moon still be white
And the river green
Sometimes I wonder if we matter at all
If we're not written down
Who will remember now
We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be
We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be
