Scaled And Icy

Good Day=
I can feel my saturation leaving me slowly
Broke the news on mom's vacation
Oh, but you know me
Low-key, I'm all right
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me
It's a good day
Lost my job, my wife and child
Homie just sued me
Shoot my life in shoot-'em-up style
Her favorite movies
Low-key, I'm all right
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me
It's a good day
Today's a good day
Never know, never know
When the next one will show, it'll show
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul
Today's a good day
Never know, never know
When the next one will show, it'll show
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul, yeah
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul
I'm all right
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me
It's a good day
I'm all right
I'm all right
I think that I'm all right
It's a good day
Choker=
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Choking on the circumstance
Only smoking second hand (mhm)
Cut us open an' spread us out (mhm)
Dry us in the sand (mhm)
Lay the fibers side by side (mhm)
And you'll begin to understand (mhm)
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me, coming for me
Mhm (I know it's over), mhm, mhm
I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Choking on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (mhm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what (mhm)
I'm able to withstand (mhm)
Sooner I can realize (mhm) that
Pain is just a middleman
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me
I see no volunteers
To co-sign on my fears
I'll sign on the line
Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now 'cause
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me (only smoking second hand)
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me, coming for me
Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out, but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screaming out, trust your mind's listening
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground, where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger and the rearview only blinds you
Shy Away=
When I get home
You better not be there, we're placing bets you won't
Shed your modesty
And the only thing to leave behind is your own skin
On the floor
Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an "I love you" (ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote, that's never heard
Don't you (sh)
When you get home
You barely recognize the pictures they put in a frame
'Cause you shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Take what you have
And leave your skin on the floor
Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an "I love you" (ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote, that's never heard
When I get home
Boy, you better not be there, you're long gone
Shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Just break the cycle in half
And leave your skin on the floor
Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an "I love you" (ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote
That's never heard
That's never heard
And I love you
There isn't words
Like a song he wrote
That's never heard
Don't you shy away
The Outside=
I'm already bored
I'm pretty sure I've seen this one before
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again
Singing out
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again
Singing out
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I am a Megalodon, oceans feeling like a pond
Swimming like a beast, underneath they be clinging on
Meteoric rise, in prehistoric times
Now that meteor is coming, coming
I am Megatron, cogs I'm stepping on
Then the little cogs got together, start a renaissance
Switched it up on me, fuel efficiency
On fumes I am running, running, running
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I'm on the outside in the summer heat
You can pay the cover charge, I'm in the street
Little do they know that they can't touch me
I'm vibin', vibin'
I'm on the outside in the summer heat
You can pay the cover charge, I'm in the street
Little do they know that they can't touch me
I'm vibin', vibin', yeah
Saturday=
Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)
Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
Lose my sense a time or two
Weeks feel like days
Medicate in the afternoon
And I just want to know
Have you lost your footing, too?
I just pray that I'm not losing you
Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh
Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)
Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
Ooh, you're good
These are my dancing shoes
We paint the town
Ooh, you're good
Thought I would dance with you
Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
Life moves slow on the ocean floor (feeling great)
I can't feel the waves anymore
Did the tide forget to move?
I just pray that I'm not losing you
Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah
Working on music?
I'll just to go to bed, I'm tired
I wanna watch "Friends" with you
Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired
You should just go for it
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
We paint, paint
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Never Take It=
Now that they know information (information)
Is just a currency and nothing more
Keep the truth in quotations (in quotations)
'Cause they keep lying through their fake teeth
Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize
You and I, we'll never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I, we'll never take it
Why cure disease of confusion (of confusion)
When you're the treatment facility?
How can we seek restitution (restitution)
When they keep lying through their fake teeth?
Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize
You and I, we'll never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I, we'll never take it
We'll never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I will never take it from 'em (ooh, ooh)
The summer I watched the tube I saw enough
Taught myself to play guitar, tearing it up
And my advice on those two things that I picked up
You better educate yourself but never too much
The summer I watched the tube I saw enough (I saw enough)
Taught myself to play guitar, tearing it up (tearing it up)
And my advice on those two things that I picked up (I picked up)
You better educate yourself but never too much
Never take it, oh-oh-oh
They profit from a great divide
You and I, we'll never take it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize
You and I, we'll never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I, we'll never take it
Mulberry Street=
One, two, three, yeah
Keep your bliss
There's nothing wrong with this
Keep your bliss
There's nothing wrong with this
Keep your sunny days
Leave us in the rain
Tie strings to our hands and feet
To rain on your parade
You can have the weekends
We will live between them
Keep your pills, save your breath
And don't ever forget
Get out of our way
We're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way
We're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet
Ain't no sunny skies, 'til you finally realize
That everybody relies on synthetic highs
They find someone to prescribe
Keep your bliss
There's nothing wrong with this
We just wanna feel it all
Keep your pills, save your breath
And don't ever forget
Get out of our way
We're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way, we're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet
When times aren't the best
And I'm on the edge
I'll listen for a song in the distance
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street
And don't ever forget
Get out of our way
We're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way
We're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet
Get out of our way, we're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way (so good, so good)
We're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet (so good to see you)
Keep your bliss
There's nothing wrong with this
Formidable=
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might be cynical towards you
But I just can't believe that I'm for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know (yeah)
And I know that we just met
But could you take me everywhere you've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might bе clinical, don't you tell
I won't break your heart if you can brеak my spell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
Fast-forward 13 years now
Don't know what it was, but somehow we played it out in reverse
I'm afraid of you now, more than I was at first
And I know you just left, but can I take you everywhere we've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might be cynical towards you
I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
Bounce Man=
You should bounce, bounce, bounce man
Come to the house, man
I'll let my old lady know
You'll be in and out, out, out man
Float you a couple bands, then you head to Mexico
I'll let my old lady know (what'd you do, man?)
My friend
Then you head to Mexico (yeah, yeah)
I-I-I don't know if you've got your phone
'Cause this went straight to voicemail
And my wife saw your face on the nightly news
Oh boy, what'd you do?
Don't matter now, if you need a piece
I'll break it down (break it down)
You should bounce, bounce, bounce man
Come to the house, man
I'll let my old lady know
You'll be in and out, out, out man
Float you a couple bands, then you head to Mexico
Yeah, I told you all along
Running away don't make you wrong
Before you bounce, bounce, bounce man
Come to the house, man
We'll sing one more song
So long
I'll let my old lady know, so long
Then you head to Mexico
If they come knockin' (pop, pop, pop)
Ain't no stoppin' me for you
Just let me know you're good on your amenities
Got soldiers on my pedigree
If you don't reply (if you don't reply)
I'll know you must have crossed state lines
She's been cryin', but I'll tell her you're fine
Don't matter now
If you need a piece, I'll break it down (break it down)
You should bounce, bounce, bounce man
Come to the house, man
I'll let my old lady know

So long
No Chances=
We come for you, no chances
We come for you, no chances
In my house, shoes on a foot race
In this house, we got feng shui
Get the door to blow you away
Flamethrower, you're a switchblade
Feet planted on grip tape
With my shoulders square and my back straight
Go a good base and a loose tongue
Notorious in the octagon, now
We got people on the way
We want you home in one piece now (run away, run away)
We get bodies every day
We want you home in one piece now
We come for you, no chances
We come for you, no chances
How did you get the location? Put together pieces?
They say they sell the information in those terms of agreement
We spend some weekends on the grind
Surveillance is outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
Spent some weekends on the grind
Surveillance is outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
We got people on the way

We get bodies every day

Redecorate=
There was a wonderful structure to the city
And it put my cares to rest
Taking inventory of his life
Seeing snapshots chronologically in line
Something told him he should look around and tidy up
He collected many things but never quite enough
Tried looking at it from a new perspective
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived
Never asked permissions he just hopes that they forgive
I don't want to go like this
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions
Wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it
She's not afraid of her reflection
But of what she might see behind it
She had plans to change her name
Just not the traditional way
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates
Then one night she got cold with no blankets on her bed
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said
I don't want to go like this
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions
Wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Like an isolated track
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
I repeat, scaled back and isolated
He says he likes an open schedule but he mostly hates it
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break-in
Put your ear up to the door, tell me can you hear him saying?
I don't want to go like this
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions
Wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
I don't want to go like this (go like this)
At least let me clean my room (clean my room)
I don't want to leave like this (leave like this)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is (to do is)
Make my people make decisions
Wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display (on display)
Or redecorate?
Or redecorate?
Or redecorate?
